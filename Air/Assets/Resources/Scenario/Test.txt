Bill:Hi there!
Claire:This was loaded from a file. Pretty neat huh?
Bill:Blank lines do nothing
Bill:Writing 'Conversation:xxxx' makes a new conversation called 'xxxx'
Claire:Writing 'EnterActor:Actor_Name' creates an EnterActor node calling in 'Actor_Name'
Claire:Same with ExitActor
Bill:After importing you will of course have to tweak various settings of the Nodes inside of Unity.
Claire:Importing a script is useful for getting a start, or if you've already written the script.
Claire:You can either import .txt files or Microsoft Excel files.
